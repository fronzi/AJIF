##  Project Overview

This repository contains supporting material for the AJIF-funded project  
**“Conversion of CO$_2$ into Methanol via an Innovative Photocatalytic and Electrocatalytic Process for Sustainable Energy Applications.”**  

The project combines **computational screening** and **experimental synthesis** of hybrid two-dimensional (2D) materials designed to catalyse the hydrogenation of CO₂ to methanol under sustainable conditions.  
Our goal is to link theoretical electronic descriptors with experimentally verified catalytic performance.

##  Computational Study

Systematic **Density Functional Theory (DFT)** calculations were used to evaluate **94 two-dimensional bilayer heterostructures** composed of combinations of graphene and transition-metal oxides (CuO, AgO, WO₃).  
Each system was analysed for:

- Work function and vacuum level  
- Band-edge alignment with respect to CO₂ redox potentials  
- d-band centre analysis and catalytic implications

##  Experimental Work

A reproducible **Pulsed-Laser Deposition (PLD)** process was established to synthesise oxide–graphene bilayers on fused silica substrates.

### Fabrication highlights
- Deposition of **WO₃–carbon** bilayers as a proof-of-concept  
- Uniform and adherent films confirmed by Raman and IR spectroscopy  
- Raman spectra show **defect-rich graphitic carbon (rGO-like)**  
- Limited oxidation confirmed via infrared spectroscopy  
- Preliminary fluorescence and UV–Vis data indicate strong optical absorption
